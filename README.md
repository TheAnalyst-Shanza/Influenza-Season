# Influenza-Season
“Analysis of U.S. influenza season trends to identify peak periods, high-risk regions, and vulnerable populations, supporting data-driven healthcare planning and resource allocation.”

## 🦠 Influenza Season Analysis

### Overview

During the U.S. influenza season (peak months December–February), hospitals and public-health systems experience increased patient demand. This project analyzes seasonal trends, regional risk, and vulnerable populations to support proactive planning, resource allocation, and prevention strategies.

### Objectives

Forecast seasonal influenza trends.

Identify high-risk states and vulnerable populations (65+, children).

Support staffing, bed capacity, and vaccine outreach planning.

Provide actionable insights for surge preparedness.

### Methods

Data cleaning and preprocessing.

Seasonal trend and time-series analysis.

Grouping and population-based analysis.

Data visualization and dashboard development.

### Key Insights

Influenza deaths peak during January, February, and December.

States with larger 65+ populations show consistently higher mortality.

Older adults exhibit a clear upward trend in influenza-related deaths.

Influenza risk is strongly seasonal and age-dependent.

### Outcome

Enabled early identification of peak-risk periods.

Highlighted regions and populations requiring targeted intervention.

Supported data-driven decisions for healthcare staffing and capacity.

Improved preparedness for influenza-related surges.

### Tools

Python (data analysis)

Tableau (visualizations & dashboards)

Excel (data preparation)

### Visualizations
